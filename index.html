                    In the 1950s economist Harry Markowitz developed Markowitz Portfolio Theory, 
                    or simply Modern Portfolio Theory. Modern Portfolio Theory is a framework for selecting optimized financial portfolios.  
                    <br><br>
                    Financial assets have various levels of risk and return. 
                    Investors obviously prefer higher returns, but they also prefer to have lower risk. 
                    In this sense there is a trade-off between risk and reward and financial portfolios 
                    need to be considered on a risk-adjusted basis. Markowitz Portfolios are the set 
                    of portfolios that maximize returns for a given level of volatility. This set of 
                    optimal portfolios is also called the efficient frontier. 
                    <br><br>
                    Using this framework, we build our own efficient portfolios below.
                </p>
                <h4 class='mt-3'>Building Portfolios</h4>     
                <p>
                    First, we randomly selected 25 securities that are included in the S&P 500 and 
                    pulled their daily adjusted closes for the calendar year of 2019. 
                    The closing prices are then used to calculate daily returns for each ticker 
                    which are then converted into annualized returns. 
                    <br><br>
                    Next, we randomly generate a set of 100,000 portfolios with random weights assigned
                     to each security. Then we calculate each portfolio’s annualized return and its 
                     volatility using the covariance of the securities.
                     These are the two core factors we need for selecting efficient Markowitz Portfolios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One common Markowitz portfolio is the Max Sharpe Ratio portfolio (MSR). 
                    The Sharpe ratio is essentially the ratio found by dividing a portfolio’s return 
                    by its volatility. The portfolio with the greatest Sharpe ratio is called the MSR. 
                    And, the MSR is always Markowitz portfolio.  
                    <br><br>
                    Another common Markowitz portfolio is the Global Minimum Volatility portfolio (GMV). 
                    It is simply the portfolio with the lowest volatility. 
                    The GMV is also always a Markowitz portfolio. 
                    
                    Below we find these two Markowitz Portfolios and compare them with
                     a uniformly distributed portfolio and the
                    S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the results.
                </p>
                <h4 class='mt-3'> Simulation Results </h4>
                <p>Graphing the simulation results can be quite informative. Here we have a scatterplot of the 100,000 portfolios, with volatility on the x-axis and returns on the y-axis. The color is mapped according to the portfolios Sharpe ratio.
                     Since investors prefer low risk and high returns, the direction of increasing preference points 
                     towards the top left corner. 
                     </p>

                <p> 
                        We can see the MSR and GMV are both towards the upper left corner as expected.
                         Both of these portfolios are Markowitz Portfolios – they have the maximum 
                         return for a given level of volatility. Notice that for both of these portfolios
                          there exists no portfolio which gives the same return with lower risk,
                         nor any portfolio which has greater return with equal risk.
                <br><br>
                The equally weighted portfolio and the S&P 500 both lie near the middle of the group.
                 We can see that these are in fact inefficient portfolios. 
                 There are other portfolios availiable with lower risk and equal return (to the left) 
                 and portfolios with higher return and equal risk (above).
                 All of those portfolios are preferable.
